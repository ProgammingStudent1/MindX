        <p>
          <b class="tlinetit">Early years</b> <br> <br>
          The Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. <br>
          They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.<br> <br>
          Led by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946–47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one.<br>
          The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.<br>
          Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.<br> <br> <br>

        <p>
          <b class="tlinetit">The Wilt Chamberlain era</b>  <br> <br>
          In 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as "Wilt the Stilt", he led the team in scoring six times,<br>
          quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever.<br> <br> <br>

          In 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team,<br>
          and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming the team: The San Francisco Warriors.

          <b class="tlinetit"> Thurmond and Barry </b> <br> <br>
          In 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA Finals in the 1966–67 season,
          losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers. <br> <br>

          The franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971–72 season, in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.<br>
          Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City.<br>
          Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.<br> <br>

          <h2>1978-1985</h2>
            <b class="tlinetit">A period of struggles</b> <br> <br>
            <p>Due of the loss of key players such as Barry,
            Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements,
            the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987
            after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s.
            Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978),
            former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976),
            who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become
            Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll.

          <p>
            <b class="tlinetit">Wilderness years</b>  <br> <br>
          Longtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo,
          who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers,
          replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997–98 season.
          Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper
          and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, 
          generating the glaring newspaper headline "WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM" and the declaration 
          by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again.
          He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks
          for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. <br> <br>

          <p>
            <b class="tlinetit">New manager</b> <br> <br>
            St. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997;
            he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles
            early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.
            St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings,
            John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops,
            such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal)
            and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available.
            St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State),
            a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006–07 season

        <h2>First superstar ever since Mullin</h2>
        For a few years, with rising stars Richardson,
        small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team,
        the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough
        in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002–03 season,
        St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson,
        donal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable
        to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented
        in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars. 
        Chris Mullin succeeded St. Jean with the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations
        in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedriņš from Latvia (11th overall).
        At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis,<br> <br>
        <img src="img/barda.jpg" style="width:350px; height:390px;"> <br>
        Baron Davis <br> <br>
         bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself.
        The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005–06 season,
        entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994,
        but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries.

        <h2>After injuries</h2>
        <p>
        Led by a healthy Baron Davis,
        an ever-improving Jason Richardson and
        young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedriņš,
        the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations
        of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style 
        f play.They became the NBA's first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series.
